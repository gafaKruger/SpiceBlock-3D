# SpiceBlock-3D

Basically, this is desktop a Java app for manipulating 3D block cubes.

The app has some operations to manipulate the block cubes: translation, rotation and scale.
It's possible to generate other types of geometrical entities by grouping and/or disgrouping the cubes. 
The aforementioned operations can be also applied to the entities formed by group cubes.

Other primitives and its respective manipulation will be inserted further.
